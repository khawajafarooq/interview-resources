Java Core:

#The Architecture

Java's architecture arises out of four distinct but interrelated technologies:

    the Java programming language
    the Java class file format
    the Java Application Programming Interface
    the Java virtual machine 

When you write and run a Java program, you are tapping the power of these four technologies. You express the program in source files 
written in the Java programming language, compile the source to Java class files, and run the class files on a Java virtual machine. 
When you write your program, you access system resources (such as I/O, for example) by calling methods in the classes that implement 
the Java Application Programming Interface, or Java API. As your program runs, it fulfills your program's Java API calls by invoking 
methods in class files that implement the Java API.
