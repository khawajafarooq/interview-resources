#####Linux vs Unix
Linux is a clone of Unix. Unix OS normally comes from a single vendor.
Linux is just a kernel. All Linux distributions includes GUI system + GNU utilities (such as cp, mv, ls,date, bash etc) + installation & management tools + GNU c/c++ Compilers + Editors (vi) + and various applications (such as OpenOffice, Firefox). However, most UNIX operating systems are considered as a complete operating system as everything come from a single source or vendor.


####PDF -> Page 82
- man command_name -> details of a command
- whatis command_name -> returns all the commands that match the specific keyword. Each command also contains its description.

#### PDF -> Page 84 -> Directories
- ls -lh -> Shows the list of files/folders in a directory with all the information but the filze size is more human readable with KB/MBs.
- mkdir -p foldername -> example mkdir -p A/B/C, now if A and B do not exist then -p will create those folders.
- rmdir -p foldername -> same as above. recursivly delete folders (only if they are empty).
- ls /folder1 /folder2 -> lists all the files in both folders at once
            
- FILES NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE
- Everything on Linux is a FILE. Files, processes, folders, HD partitions etc
